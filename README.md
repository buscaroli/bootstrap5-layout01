# GETTING TO KNOW BOOTSTRAP 5

Learning the basics of Bootstrap 5 by creating a single-page website with a veru basic layout and only using Bootstrap own classes.

## Project 1

This is the first project of a series where I intend to explore different components and different ways of combining them.

### Components

I have used the following components:

- container
- grid
- carousel
- listgroup
- navbar
- card
- utilities
  - text
  - display
  - background
  - flex
  - responsive columns
